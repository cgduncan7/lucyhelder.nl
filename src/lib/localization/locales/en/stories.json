    "body": "In Granada the dogs still just poop all over the street. I've dodged hundreds or thousands of turds since I've been here. But today I stepped in a croquette. In the middle of the street. Instead of focusing on what this croquette was doing there, I wondered what are the chances? Statistically speaking. I'm convinced that I've got a better odds winning the post code lottery. Of course I know it doesn't work this way but in the moment (scraping ragout, Serrano ham, and the crunchy crust of a croquette out of the grooves of your shoes) you definitely consider placing your bets."
